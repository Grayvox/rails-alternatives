# Rails Alternatives

Welcome to the Rails Alternatives list - a curated guide to frameworks for those that have lived in the Rails world for a while but want to branch off.

Rails is great and all - but branching off is never a bad thing. Many other web frameworks exist, but for those that truly enjoy the Rails way, this list will provide other frameworks that are similar in nature.

**Most Starred Framework on Rails Alternatives:**

ü•á [Django](https://github.com/django/django)

ü•à [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel)

ü•â [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)

## DISCLAIMER

This guide is in no way meant to convince you of using any one framework - nor is it meant to convince you to not use frameworks that isn't listed here. It is simply meant to offer a list of alternative web frameworks similar in nature to Rails for anyone who's interested in trying them. What you learn is your choice.

There are some frameworks not listed here that some would argue are Rails-like, but were not added because they are not standalone and require a larger framework to work.
